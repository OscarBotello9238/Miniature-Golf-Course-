# Miniature-Golf-Course-
This is a project I worked on during my first year as an undergraduate mechanical engineering student. Collaborating with a team of mechanical and electrical engineers, we designed and built a medieval-themed miniature golf course featuring dynamic, Arduino-controlled obstacles. The project involved 3D printing, laser cutting, and full mechanical assembly.
One of the obstacles I personally designed and fabricated was a motorized castle gate that opened and closed as players approached—a nod to the "Kingdom" theme. This obstacle was powered and programmed using an Arduino microcontroller, adding both interactivity and immersion to the course.
